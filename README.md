##CSUMBeacon
We are creating an application that acts as a tour guide for a tour around campus using bluetooth low energy beacons. This product will provide an interactive experience during campus tours. At the moment we are planning on making this application be relevant to campus tours. If it works to our expectation we are planning on expanding the development to interactive classrooms, museums, and historical sites. We are predicting that the involvement the application provides, the user will be able to have a better experience and better accessibility to the information if they are unable to afford to pay for a tour.
